#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0

; ===== CONFIGURATION =====
; Time window in milliseconds within which keys must be pressed and released
comboTimeWindow := 80

; Define your combo keys and actions here
; Format: [key1, key2, ...], Action
comboKeysList := [
    ; Example: j and k pressed together within the time window will send "Hello World"
    [["j", "k"], () => SendText("Hello World")],
    
    ; Example: a, s, d pressed together will run Notepad
    [["a", "s", "d"], () => Run("notepad.exe")]
